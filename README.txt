A best practices implementation of OAuth for Drupal.  

What is OAuth?

"An open protocol to allow secure API authentication in a simple and
standard method from desktop and web applications."

If you've ever used Flickr to connect with other systems, or added a
Facebook app that asks you what permissions you want to give, both are
examples of securely identifying yourself between systems without you
physically having to enter a password every time.

A very simplistic explanation is that OpenID is like your car key: you
have to be at the web page / service to log in.

OAuth is like a valet key, that you can hand to a website to operate
on your behalf, even when you're not there.

TO DO

1. allow OAuth between two Drupal sites
  a) have the token be passed etc.
  b) some small "thing" that can be done remotely and is non-trivial
  and has few if any dependiences (i.e. core D6 + Oauth on both sides)
  -- probably something with profile.module or username

2. Enable OAuth with some 3rd party system
  a) choose a particular service -- my recommendation is Magnolia --

  b) implement some small thing -- maybe the beginnings of a magnolia module
